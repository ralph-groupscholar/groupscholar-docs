# Communications Guide

## Summary

Group Scholar favors clear, asynchronous updates with lightweight rituals to keep momentum. This guide defines where we communicate, how we make decisions visible, and how we handle urgency.

## Communication principles

- Be concise, complete, and action-oriented.
- Default to async unless the issue is urgent or ambiguous.
- Leave a written trail for decisions, risks, and customer impact.
- Protect focus time; use meetings to unblock, not to think alone.

## Channels and use cases

- **Email:** External stakeholder updates, formal approvals, contracts, and long-form summaries.
- **Slack:** Quick coordination, alerts, and lightweight check-ins. Avoid long threads for decisions.
- **Docs:** Canonical decisions, playbooks, and project updates. If it matters, document it.
- **Calendar:** Reserved for synchronous discussions and decision points.

## Response expectations

- **P0 incidents:** Immediate response. Use phone or escalation path.
- **Urgent internal blockers:** Respond within 2 hours during business day.
- **Standard internal requests:** Respond within 1 business day.
- **External stakeholders:** Respond within 1 business day unless agreed otherwise.

## Async update format

Use this structure in Slack or docs for project updates:

- **Status:** On track / At risk / Blocked
- **Progress:** 2 to 4 bullets on what moved forward
- **Decisions:** What was decided and why
- **Risks:** Anything that could shift the timeline
- **Next:** 1 to 3 concrete next steps

## Meeting norms

- Share a short agenda in advance with desired outcomes.
- Start on time; end early if outcomes are met.
- Assign a note taker when decisions are expected.
- Capture action items with owners and due dates.
- Post a recap in the relevant doc or channel.

## Decision records

- Log major decisions in the relevant project doc within 24 hours.
- Include context, options considered, and final rationale.
- Link to any supporting customer input or data.

## Escalation path

1. Ask the directly responsible individual in the project channel.
2. Escalate to the project lead after 2 hours for urgent blockers.
3. Escalate to leadership for customer impact or timeline risk.

## External communications

- Confirm confidentiality before sharing internal documents.
- Use approved language for product positioning and commitments.
- Route press or partner requests to leadership.
