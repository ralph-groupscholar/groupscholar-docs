# Risk & Compliance Guide

## Summary
This guide defines how Group Scholar identifies, tracks, and mitigates operational, legal, and program risks. It sets a shared compliance calendar and clear owners for audits, policy reviews, and corrective actions.

## Risk register
- Maintain a single risk register with owner, severity, likelihood, and mitigation plan.
- Review new risks during weekly ops check-ins; log any material changes within 48 hours.
- Use severity bands: Low, Medium, High, Critical.
- Close a risk only when mitigation is implemented and validated.

## Compliance calendar
- Quarterly: policy review, access recertification, vendor risk review.
- Biannual: program eligibility audit, scholarship award sample review.
- Annual: data retention review, incident response exercise, legal/compliance refresh.

## Core policies
- Data handling and privacy requirements live in Security & Privacy.
- Grant and scholarship compliance: award criteria, documentation standards, and audit trail.
- Vendor and procurement compliance: contracts, approvals, and renewal checks.
- Marketing compliance: claims, approvals, and brand standards.

## Controls and evidence
- Require a documented owner for each control.
- Store evidence in a shared folder with date and owner (e.g., audits, approvals, logs).
- Tag evidence with the related policy and risk ID.

## Audit readiness
- Keep a 12-month archive of key program decisions and award documentation.
- Maintain a list of systems of record and where evidence is stored.
- Prepare an audit summary within 5 business days of request.

## Escalation and remediation
- Escalate High or Critical risks within 24 hours to Operations and Leadership.
- Create a remediation plan with milestones and a single accountable owner.
- Track remediation in the risk register until verified closed.

## Ownership and metrics
- Ops owns the risk register and compliance calendar.
- Track: number of open High/Critical risks, days-to-close, and audit findings count.
