# Learning & Development

## Summary

Build a consistent learning system so every Group Scholar teammate can ramp fast, deepen expertise, and deliver excellent scholar outcomes. This guide defines how we design training, track progress, and keep enablement aligned with program goals.

## Objectives

- Shorten time-to-impact for new hires and cross-functional partners.
- Maintain high-quality delivery as programs and products evolve.
- Capture and reuse institutional knowledge, not just tribal know-how.
- Grow specialized skills in advising, operations, data, and support.

## Core principles

- Role-based, not one-size-fits-all.
- Practice-driven: simulations, shadowing, and real workflows.
- Documented, reusable, and versioned.
- Measured for outcomes, not completion alone.

## Learning tracks

- **Scholar success track:** advising, safeguarding, communications, and support case handling.
- **Program delivery track:** cohort operations, grant compliance, event coordination, and reporting.
- **Product & data track:** tooling workflows, analytics literacy, and data privacy.
- **Partner & donor track:** stewardship cadences, partner meetings, and narrative updates.
- **People leadership track:** coaching, performance cycles, and escalation hygiene.

## Onboarding flow (first 30 days)

- **Week 1:** company overview, core docs, tools, and mentor pairing.
- **Week 2:** shadow sessions, draft deliverables with review, and feedback loop.
- **Week 3:** independent workflow execution with QA checks.
- **Week 4:** capstone deliverable reviewed by owner and archived as a template.

## Enablement assets

- Curriculum maps by role and level.
- Recorded walkthroughs for recurring workflows.
- Scenario scripts for scholar and partner conversations.
- Rubrics for quality checks (review operations, support, compliance).
- Templates for briefs, updates, and program artifacts.

## Governance & ownership

- **Enablement owner:** people operations partner or functional lead.
- **Content owners:** each functional lead maintains their curriculum.
- **Review cadence:** quarterly refresh with change log notes.
- **Approval path:** content owners → enablement owner → executive sponsor.

## Metrics & reporting

- Time-to-first independent delivery (by role).
- Quality score after 30 and 90 days (QA or peer review).
- Training completion rate with impact notes.
- Confidence and readiness survey (monthly pulse).
- Knowledge base freshness (last updated date per asset).

## Tooling & storage

- Use the docs repo for canonical material.
- Link live templates and checklists from the docs index.
- Store recordings in the shared drive with consistent naming.
- Maintain a training calendar in the ops workspace.

## Continuous improvement

- Collect feedback after each cohort cycle or major program launch.
- Log confusing steps and update playbooks within one sprint.
- Run quarterly enablement retros and publish action items.
- Retire outdated assets to avoid conflicting guidance.

## Escalations

- If a training gap creates a delivery risk, alert the functional lead within 24 hours.
- If a compliance gap is found, notify legal/compliance immediately.
- Document incidents and include remediation steps in the learning log.

## Quick start checklist

- Identify new role or program.
- Assign learning track owner.
- Draft curriculum map and required artifacts.
- Schedule shadowing and simulations.
- Define QA criteria and sign-off steps.
- Publish versioned materials and announce updates.
