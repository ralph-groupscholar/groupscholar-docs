# Impact & Metrics Guide

## Summary
This guide defines how Group Scholar measures program impact, tracks operational health, and shares results with partners.

## Measurement principles
- Measure outcomes first, outputs second.
- Prefer leading indicators that enable early course correction.
- Use consistent definitions across cohorts and partners.
- Document data lineage and owners for every metric.

## North-star outcomes
- Scholar progression (grade-to-grade promotion and completion).
- Academic growth (assessment or benchmark improvement).
- Persistence and attendance in Group Scholar programs.
- Long-term pathways (secondary school completion, placement, or employment).

## Operational health metrics
- Cohort enrollment rate and time-to-fill.
- Mentor-to-scholar ratio and coverage gaps.
- Session delivery rate and make-up completion.
- Partner responsiveness (average turnaround on requests).
- Scholar satisfaction (NPS or equivalent feedback score).

## Data sources and ownership
- Program operations: attendance logs, session reports, mentor rosters.
- Academic outcomes: partner assessments, internal evaluations.
- Engagement: survey tools, feedback forms, interview notes.
- Ownership: each metric has a named owner and backup in the ops roster.

## Reporting cadence
- Weekly: cohort health snapshot for program leads.
- Monthly: partner impact summary with narrative insights.
- Quarterly: organization-wide impact review and risk assessment.
- Annual: impact report with longitudinal trends and stories.

## Metric definitions (examples)
- Scholar progression: % of scholars advancing to next grade on time.
- Attendance rate: attended sessions / scheduled sessions.
- Mentor coverage: filled mentor slots / required slots.
- Satisfaction: average survey rating + qualitative themes.

## Quality checks
- Validate data within five business days of collection.
- Flag anomalies (missing sessions, outliers, duplicate records).
- Run quarterly audits of definitions and data owners.

## Dashboards and artifacts
- Use a single source of truth dashboard for each cohort.
- Keep a shared metrics glossary in the docs folder.
- Store reports in a predictable folder structure by year and cohort.

## Escalation
- Any metric below target for two consecutive cycles triggers an action plan.
- Program lead owns the action plan; ops lead approves.
- Update partners on remediation steps within one reporting cycle.
