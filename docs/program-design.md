# Program Design & Review

## Summary

Use this guide to design scholarship programs that are fair, repeatable, and measurable. It covers scope, eligibility, rubric design, review workflow, and launch readiness.

## Design goals

- Center equity, accessibility, and transparency in every decision.
- Align program outcomes with measurable impact metrics.
- Make reviewer decisions consistent through clear criteria and calibration.
- Reduce applicant friction with clear requirements and timelines.

## Program blueprint

- **Purpose statement:** One sentence on who the program serves and why it exists.
- **Award structure:** Number of awards, award size, renewal policy, and disbursement timing.
- **Eligibility scope:** Geography, education level, identity or need-based criteria, and exclusions.
- **Application inputs:** Required fields, supporting documents, and optional artifacts.
- **Timeline:** Launch date, close date, review window, decision date, and announcement date.

## Equity & accessibility checks

- Provide alternative submission formats (text, PDF, video) when possible.
- Ensure eligibility criteria are outcome-focused, not proxy-based.
- Publish a plain-language FAQ and examples of strong applications.
- Validate that required documents are realistic for target applicants.

## Rubric and scoring

- Use 3-5 rubric criteria with clear definitions and examples.
- Define score bands (e.g., 1-5) with anchors for each band.
- Add a short reviewer note field for context on edge cases.
- Require calibration on a shared sample set before scoring live applications.

## Review workflow

- **Intake triage:** Remove incomplete submissions or request missing info.
- **Round one:** Two independent reviewers score each application.
- **Reconciliation:** Resolve score gaps above the agreed threshold.
- **Final selection:** Review top candidates with a structured decision log.

## Communications cadence

- Launch announcement with timeline and eligibility summary.
- Reminder emails at midpoint and 72 hours before close.
- Decision notifications with next steps and feedback pathways.
- Post-award onboarding message with payout and reporting details.

## Risk and compliance

- Document data retention periods and deletion workflows.
- Record conflict-of-interest disclosures from reviewers.
- Confirm accessibility of all forms and assets before launch.
- Maintain an audit log of decisions and scoring changes.

## Metrics and retrospectives

- Applicant volume by channel and eligibility segment.
- Completion rate and average time to complete application.
- Reviewer calibration variance and decision turnaround time.
- Award recipient outcomes and follow-up participation rate.

## Launch readiness checklist

- Program blueprint approved and posted.
- Rubric finalized and calibration completed.
- Review workflow assigned with named owners.
- Communications plan scheduled.
- Metrics dashboard created and baseline metrics captured.
