# Culture & Values

## Summary
Group Scholar's culture centers on curiosity, generosity, and responsible stewardship. We collaborate with clarity, move with intent, and protect the trust our community places in us.

## Our values

- Learner's mindset: stay curious, ask better questions, and share what you learn.
- Service first: prioritize the community, the mission, and long-term impact.
- Trust through transparency: communicate early, document decisions, and surface risks.
- Craft with care: ship quality work, sweat the details that matter, and iterate.
- Ownership: take initiative, follow through, and support teammates.

## How we work together

- Default to clear writing: summaries, context, and next steps.
- Disagree in the open, align in private, commit as one team.
- Protect focus: minimize meetings, batch decisions, and respect deep work.
- Keep a steady pace: prioritize sustainability over heroics.

## Rituals

- Weekly wins: share impact and lessons learned every Friday.
- Monthly retros: identify what to keep, start, and stop.
- Quarterly strategy reviews: recalibrate goals and success metrics.

## Decision principles

- Community impact beats internal convenience.
- Clarity beats speed when the stakes are high.
- If it isn't documented, it isn't done.

## Signals we are off-track

- Repeated rework due to unclear ownership or context.
- Delayed responses without explicit expectations.
- Decisions made without recorded rationale.

## Improvements

- Add specific examples of high-impact behaviors as we grow.
- Evolve rituals as team size and cadence change.
