# Security & Privacy

## Summary
Group Scholar protects student, partner, and internal data through least-privilege access, clear handling standards, and a disciplined incident response process.

## Data handling principles
- Collect the minimum data required to deliver programs and measure impact.
- Classify data as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit where supported by the platform.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in personal notes or unapproved tools.

## Access controls
- Access is role-based and approved by the data owner.
- Review access quarterly and remove stale accounts.
- Use single sign-on and MFA where available.
- Never share credentials or API keys in chat or email.

## Incident response
- Report suspected incidents immediately in the #security channel.
- Preserve evidence and avoid deleting logs or messages.
- Security lead coordinates triage, containment, and stakeholder updates.
- Document the timeline, impact, and remediations in a post-incident review.

## Vendor and tool risk
- New tools require a privacy review and data flow diagram.
- Prefer vendors with strong security posture and clear SLAs.
- Maintain a list of approved tools in the operations playbook.

## Privacy commitments
- Honor partner data retention terms and deletion requests.
- Use aggregated or anonymized data in external reporting.
- Ensure consent language is embedded in program workflows.

## Reporting concerns
If you see risky behavior or a potential policy gap, contact the security lead or operations owner the same day.
