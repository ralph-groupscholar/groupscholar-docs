# Strategic Planning & OKRs

## Summary
Group Scholar uses a lightweight, outcome-first planning system that connects annual priorities to quarterly OKRs, team roadmaps, and weekly execution. This guide defines the planning cadence, decision gates, and artifacts required to keep strategy and delivery aligned.

## Planning cadence
- Annual: confirm mission priorities, target outcomes, and funding guardrails.
- Quarterly: set OKRs, define initiative owners, and finalize resource trade-offs.
- Monthly: review leading indicators, unblock dependencies, and adjust sequencing.
- Weekly: track commitments, surface risks, and close feedback loops.

## Annual planning flow
- Refresh org-level outcomes (3–5) with success metrics and equity targets.
- Establish budget envelopes per program, platform, and shared services.
- Approve top cross-functional initiatives with an executive sponsor.
- Publish the annual narrative and assumptions to the docs hub.

## Quarterly OKR workflow
- Draft OKRs using measurable outcomes, not activities.
- Map each objective to 1–3 initiatives with clear owners.
- Validate capacity: team bandwidth, partner dependencies, and funding.
- Review in a planning council, then finalize and publish.

## OKR quality rubric
- Outcome anchored: includes a measurable change in the world.
- Specific and time-bound: clear timeframe and target.
- Owned: single accountable lead and supporting team(s).
- Feasible: grounded in capacity and dependencies.
- Equitable: considers access, fairness, and disparate impact.

## Core artifacts
- Strategy memo: annual priorities, assumptions, and constraints.
- OKR register: objectives, key results, owners, and status.
- Initiative briefs: scope, milestones, risks, and dependencies.
- Resource map: staffing, budget, and tooling commitments.
- Decision log: major trade-offs, with rationale and date.

## Governance & decision rights
- Executive team approves annual priorities and budgets.
- Planning council approves quarterly OKRs and sequencing changes.
- Program leads own initiative delivery with weekly reporting.
- Operations owns the cadence calendar and artifact hygiene.

## Reporting & visibility
- Weekly: initiative health, risks, and next milestones.
- Monthly: leading indicator dashboard and dependency review.
- Quarterly: OKR scoring with learnings and carryovers.

## Planning health signals
- Less than 10% of initiatives lack an owner.
- 90%+ of OKRs have measurable outcomes defined.
- Decision log updated within 5 business days of a change.
- Quarterly review includes at least 2 cross-team learnings.

## Templates
- Use the Group Scholar strategy memo template in the shared drive.
- Use the OKR register spreadsheet for quarterly tracking.
- Store initiative briefs in the "Initiatives" folder under Operations.

## Immediate next steps
- Confirm the upcoming planning council dates.
- Draft the annual outcome refresh for review.
- Audit the current OKR register for missing owners.
