# Knowledge Management & Documentation

## Summary
Standards for how Group Scholar captures, curates, and maintains knowledge so teams can move faster with confidence.

## Goals
- Keep a single source of truth for strategy, operations, and product decisions.
- Make decisions discoverable within minutes, not days.
- Reduce duplicated effort by preserving context and outcomes.

## Source-of-Truth Map
- Strategy and priorities: `company-overview.md`, `strategic-planning.md`.
- Program delivery: `program-operations.md`, `program-design.md`, `review-quality.md`.
- People and culture: `culture-values.md`, `people-operations.md`.
- Product and engineering: `product-brief.md`, `product-portfolio.md`, `engineering-handbook.md`.
- Data and compliance: `data-analytics.md`, `grant-compliance.md`, `security-privacy.md`.

## Documentation Standards
- Lead with a concise summary (3 to 5 bullets).
- Include owners, last updated date, and review cadence.
- Prefer checklists and tables over long narrative text.
- Link to canonical artifacts (dashboards, runbooks, or templates).

## Ownership & Stewardship
- Every doc has a primary owner and a backup owner.
- Owners confirm accuracy during the monthly operating review.
- If ownership changes, update the doc within 5 business days.

## Lifecycle
- Draft: used for in-progress work, tagged as "Draft" at the top.
- Active: approved and linked from the docs index or the landing page.
- Archived: no longer in use, moved to an archive section and dated.

## Review Cadence
- Quarterly: all core policy and compliance docs.
- Bi-monthly: operations, program, and product execution docs.
- Monthly: metrics, reporting, and sprint playbooks.

## Decision Records
- Use short decision logs for major changes.
- Include date, decision owner, options considered, and rationale.
- Link decisions to affected docs and roadmaps.

## Templates
- Operating playbook template.
- Meeting notes template with action log.
- Decision log template.

## Quality Checklist
- Is the owner clearly listed?
- Is the decision or process still current?
- Are there links to the latest artifacts?
- Is the last updated date within the expected cadence?

## Next Iteration
- Add a docs change log dashboard.
- Introduce a lightweight decision record registry.
- Publish a cross-team knowledge map for new hires.
