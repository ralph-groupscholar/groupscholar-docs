# Meeting Rhythm

## Summary
We use a lightweight meeting cadence to keep alignment high and time spent low. Most decisions are made asynchronously and meetings exist to unblock, decide, or coordinate.

## Principles

- Default to async updates before booking time.
- Every meeting has a written agenda and an owner.
- Small, time-boxed meetings beat large, open-ended ones.
- Decisions end with a clear owner, deadline, and next step.

## Core cadence

- Daily team check-in: 10 minutes for blockers and priorities.
- Weekly planning: 45 minutes to align goals, resourcing, and risks.
- Weekly demo: 30 minutes to show progress and gather feedback.
- Monthly retrospectives: 60 minutes for what to keep, change, and stop.
- Quarterly strategy review: 90 minutes for objectives, metrics, and roadmap.

## Standard agenda template

1. Purpose and desired outcome
2. Context and pre-reads
3. Discussion items with time boxes
4. Decision or action list
5. Owners and due dates

## Roles and expectations

- Organizer: writes the agenda and gathers pre-reads.
- Facilitator: keeps time and ensures every voice is heard.
- Decision owner: makes the call and records it.
- Note taker: captures actions and decisions in the project log.

## Post-meeting hygiene

- Send a short recap within 24 hours.
- Track action items in the team tracker.
- Cancel or combine meetings that are no longer useful.

## Good meeting hygiene

- Start and end on time.
- Cameras optional, focus required.
- One screen share at a time.
- If you cannot contribute, decline the invite.
