# Scholar Safeguarding & Crisis Response

## Summary
Guidelines for protecting scholar well-being, responding to urgent situations, and coordinating crisis workflows with clear ownership, privacy safeguards, and follow-up care.

## Objectives
- Protect scholar safety while maintaining dignity and privacy.
- Ensure consistent, rapid response across teams and partners.
- Document actions for learning, accountability, and compliance.

## Core principles
- Act quickly, then document. Speed matters more than perfect information.
- Safety over program outcomes or timelines.
- Communicate with empathy and clarity; avoid jargon or legal framing.
- Use the smallest necessary circle of access.

## What counts as a safeguarding issue
- Threats to physical safety or self-harm.
- Harassment, stalking, or abuse disclosures.
- Housing instability or urgent food insecurity that blocks participation.
- Major mental health crises or medical emergencies.
- Legal or immigration events that create immediate risk.

## Severity tiers
- **Tier 0 (Immediate threat):** Active danger or credible threat of harm.
- **Tier 1 (High risk):** Credible concern without immediate danger.
- **Tier 2 (Elevated need):** Non-urgent but significant barriers to safety.
- **Tier 3 (Support request):** General well-being check or resource request.

## Response workflow
1. **Acknowledge within 1 hour** for Tier 0–1 and within 1 business day for Tier 2–3.
2. **Assign an incident lead** and back-up; document names in the incident log.
3. **Confirm location and contact** (if appropriate), and verify preferred communication channel.
4. **Escalate externally** for Tier 0 (emergency services or partner-led rapid response).
5. **Create a safety plan** for Tier 1–2 with clear next steps and check-in schedule.
6. **Close the loop** with scholar after resolution and capture lessons learned.

## Escalation map
- **Tier 0:** Incident lead + Program Director + Executive on-call.
- **Tier 1:** Incident lead + Program Director.
- **Tier 2–3:** Incident lead + Scholar Support lead.

## Communication standards
- Keep messages short, empathetic, and action-oriented.
- Never promise outcomes you cannot guarantee.
- Share only essential details with partners or internal teams.
- Use the “mirror, affirm, next step” structure: reflect concern, affirm support, offer the next action.

## Documentation & data handling
- Record the incident in the safeguarding log within 24 hours.
- Store only factual notes; avoid speculation or diagnosis language.
- Redact sensitive details from general program updates.
- Tag the incident with tier, region, and partner (if applicable).

## Partner coordination
- Confirm partner response protocols at program kickoff.
- Maintain an updated list of partner emergency contacts.
- Coordinate handoffs with clear roles (who is primary contact, who is backup).

## Training & readiness
- Conduct quarterly tabletop exercises with program and support teams.
- Run a short refresher at every program launch.
- Maintain a ready-to-send resource pack by region.

## Metrics to track
- Time to first response by tier.
- Resolution time and follow-up completion rate.
- Recurrence rate within 90 days.
- Partner response SLA adherence.

## Templates
- **Initial response (Tier 1–2):** “Thank you for letting us know. Your safety matters, and we’re here to help. I’m [Name] and I’ll stay with you through the next steps. Can you share the best way to reach you right now?”
- **Follow-up check-in:** “Checking in to see how you’re doing and whether the plan we agreed on is still working. We can adjust anything that’s not meeting your needs.”

## Ownership
- **Primary:** Scholar Support Lead
- **Backup:** Program Director
- **Escalation:** Executive on-call
