Group Scholar events create momentum across scholars, alumni, partners, and funders. This playbook standardizes how we plan, deliver, and measure convenings so every event advances program outcomes and relationships.

## Goals

- Build belonging and trust across the scholar community.
- Capture insights that inform program design and partner strategy.
- Deliver measurable value (learning, connections, resources) for attendees.
- Create reusable assets (recordings, notes, metrics) for long-term impact.

## Event types

- Scholar onboarding cohorts (virtual or hybrid).
- Alumni networking sessions and career panels.
- Partner briefings and funder showcases.
- Training workshops (financial aid, leadership, career readiness).
- Annual summit or regional gatherings.
