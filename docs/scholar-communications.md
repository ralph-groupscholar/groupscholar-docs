# Scholar Communications & Messaging Guide

## Summary

Standards for how we communicate with scholars across the lifecycle so messages are timely, consistent, and trauma-informed while protecting privacy.

## Communication principles

- Lead with clarity: why this matters, what the scholar needs to do, and by when.
- Use supportive language: avoid jargon, keep a warm and respectful tone.
- Reduce cognitive load: use bullets, short paragraphs, and clear headings.
- Confirm next steps: include a checklist or numbered actions.
- Protect privacy: never include sensitive data in channels that are not secure.

## Core channels

- Email: primary channel for formal updates, decisions, and confirmations.
- SMS: time-sensitive reminders and short nudges (opt-in only).
- In-app: program milestones, task reminders, and resource highlights.
- Community platform: peer updates, announcements, and engagement prompts.
- Phone or video: sensitive conversations, escalation, or complex cases.

## Cadence by lifecycle stage

## Templates and content standards

- Keep body length under 250 words for action requests.
- Include a support footer with contact channels and response SLAs.
- Provide links to resources with descriptive anchor text.
- Save all templates in the shared template library with last-updated date.

## Approvals and QA

- Communications about eligibility, awards, or compliance must be reviewed by program operations.
- Legal or policy statements require legal & policy review.
- Sensitive messages (safeguarding, crisis, misconduct) require safeguarding approval.
- Run a quick accessibility check: reading level, contrast, and alt text where applicable.

## Response expectations

- Standard inquiries: respond within 2 business days.
- Urgent concerns: acknowledge within 4 business hours.
- Safeguarding or crisis signals: follow safeguarding escalation within 1 hour.

## Data handling

- Do not include PII in community posts or group emails.
- Use BCC for bulk emails unless a secure mailing tool is used.
- Log key outbound communications in the scholar record.
- Store consent and opt-in records for SMS and community platforms.

## Metrics to track

- Open and click-through rates by lifecycle stage.

- Opt-out rates for SMS and newsletters.
- Engagement by segment (new applicants, active scholars, alumni).
