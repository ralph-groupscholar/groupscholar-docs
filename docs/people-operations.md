# People Operations & Performance

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar runs performance cycles, supports growth,
compensation alignment, and a consistent manager experience.

## Principles

- Clarity beats surprises: goals, expectations, and feedback are visible early.
- Growth is supported with coaching, not just evaluation.
- Equity and transparency matter in compensation and leveling decisions.

## Core calendar

- Quarterly: goal setting, progress review, and growth plan updates.
- Biannual: formal performance review and calibration.
- Annual: compensation and leveling alignment.

## Performance cycle flow

1. Set 2-4 quarterly goals tied to outcomes and measures.
2. Run monthly 1:1s with written notes and action items.
3. Mid-cycle check-in focused on blockers and support needed.
4. End-of-cycle review with evidence, wins, and growth areas.
5. Calibration with peer managers to ensure consistent standards.

## Feedback and coaching standards

- Use the SBI format (Situation, Behavior, Impact) for clarity.
- Balance strengths with one priority growth area at a time.
- Document commitments and next steps after each coaching session.

## Growth plans

- Define a 60-90 day improvement focus with measurable outcomes.
- Provide specific resources: mentor, training, shadowing, or stretch project.
- Agree on check-in cadence and evidence needed for progress.

## Compensation and leveling

- Use defined bands and a consistent leveling rubric per role family.
- Review market data annually and adjust bands as needed.
- Tie adjustments to demonstrated scope, impact, and role expectations.

## Manager expectations

- Maintain current role scorecards and goal documentation for each report.
- Provide timely recognition and course correction.
- Escalate performance risks early with a clear support plan.

## Offboarding signals

- If a growth plan fails after support, initiate a transition review.
- Document the decision, timeline, and knowledge transfer plan.
- Coordinate with operations for access, equipment, and final pay logistics.
