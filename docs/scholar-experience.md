# Scholar Experience & Support Guide

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar delivers a consistent, caring experience for scholars from acceptance through alumni transition. Use it to align program, success, and support teams on service standards, escalation, and well-being practices.

## Goals

- Reduce friction in onboarding, stipend delivery, and program milestones.
- Protect scholar well-being, privacy, and accessibility needs.
- Capture feedback that improves program design and outcomes.

## Scholar journey stages

1. Acceptance: welcome, expectations, and next steps.
2. Onboarding: access, paperwork, and orientation.
3. Active program: milestones, coaching, and community.
4. Transition: completion, next opportunities, alumni invite.
5. Alumni: ongoing support and mentorship pathways.

## Experience principles

- Clarity first: always explain timelines, owners, and next steps.
- Dignity and care: respond with empathy, especially to sensitive requests.

## Support channels
