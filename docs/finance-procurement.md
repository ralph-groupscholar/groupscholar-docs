# Finance & Procurement Guide

## Summary
This guide explains how Group Scholar budgets, approves spend, and manages vendors so we can move fast while staying compliant.

## Principles
- Spend should map to a program outcome or operational risk reduction.
- We prefer a single source of truth for vendor contracts and renewal dates.
- Small experiments are encouraged when risk is low and learnings are clear.

## Budget ownership
- Annual budgets are owned by functional leads and reviewed quarterly.
- Project leads own line-item budgets and forecast updates.
- Any unplanned spend must document the reason and impact on goals.

## Spending thresholds
- Under $500: team lead approval.
- $500 to $2,500: functional lead approval.
- Over $2,500 or multi-year commitments: exec approval.
- Grants, scholarships, and student data tools always require legal review.

## Procurement steps
1. Define the problem, expected impact, and success criteria.
2. Evaluate at least two options for purchases over $1,000.
3. Confirm vendor security posture and data handling expectations.
4. Route the contract for legal review and signature.
5. Log the vendor in the tracker with renewal dates and owner.

## Vendor onboarding checklist
- Security questionnaire or SOC2 report attached.
- Data processing agreement signed when student data is involved.
- Billing contact and escalation contact confirmed.
- Cancellation terms and auto-renewal settings recorded.

## Contracts and legal routing
- All contracts flow through the operations lead for routing.
- Use the standard MSA where possible; track redlines if not.
- No verbal commitments; only signed documents are binding.

## Payments and reimbursements
- Prefer ACH or invoice over credit cards for recurring spend.
- Expenses must be submitted within 30 days with receipts.
- Reimbursements are paid twice per month.

## Purchasing cards
- Cards are for approved budget items only.
- Never use cards for subscriptions that need legal review.
- Report lost cards within 24 hours.

## Renewal management
- Owners must flag renewals 60 days in advance.
- Provide a keep or cancel recommendation with usage data.
- Renegotiate pricing for renewals over $2,500 annually.

## Reporting cadence
- Monthly spend summaries are shared with execs.
- Quarterly budget re-forecast is required for every function.

## Templates and trackers
- Vendor tracker
