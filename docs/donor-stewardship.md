# Donor Stewardship & Recognition

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar thanks, updates, and retains donors. It covers stewardship tiers, messaging cadence, recognition standards, and the evidence we provide to reinforce impact.

## Goals

- Build long-term donor trust through consistent, high-quality updates.
- Align recognition with donor preferences and compliance requirements.
- Turn impact evidence into clear, human stories.
- Increase renewal rates and multi-year commitments.

## Stewardship tiers

- Core donors: quarterly updates, annual impact review, annual recognition.
- Growth donors: bi-monthly updates, two impact touchpoints, optional 1:1 briefing.
- Anchor donors: monthly updates, custom impact dashboard, executive briefing.
- Foundation partners: grant-compliance aligned updates, evidence packs, site visits.

## Core artifacts

- Donor profile: goals, preferences, restrictions, recognition opt-ins.
- Stewardship plan: cadence, owners, deliverables by quarter.
- Impact evidence pack: outcomes, stories, metrics, and methodology notes.
- Recognition log: public acknowledgments, consent records, and timing.

## Cadence and touchpoints

- Weekly: monitor donor inboxes and open issues.
- Monthly: share program highlights and scholar stories.
- Quarterly: send impact summaries and spending alignment.
- Annually: host impact review, renewals, and recognition updates.

## Recognition standards

- Obtain written consent for public recognition.
- Use donor-preferred name, title, and organization format.
- Rotate recognition placement to avoid overexposure.
- For anonymous donors, highlight impact without identifying details.

## Workflow

1. Intake donor preferences during onboarding or renewal.
2. Build a quarterly stewardship plan with owners and due dates.
3. Collect impact evidence, verify with data team, draft narrative.
4. Send update, log response, and schedule next touchpoint.
5. At renewal, summarize last 12 months and deliver a forward plan.

## Metrics

- Renewal rate by donor tier.
- On-time update delivery rate.
- Donor satisfaction score from post-brief surveys.
- Net revenue retained by stewardship cohort.

## Risks and mitigations

- Overpromising outcomes: use conservative claims and verified data.
- Inconsistent updates: maintain a stewardship calendar with owners.
- Recognition errors: require a second review before public releases.

## Owners

- Stewardship lead: overall cadence and communications.
- Impact lead: evidence pack and data verification.
- Partnerships lead: renewal strategy and escalation.
