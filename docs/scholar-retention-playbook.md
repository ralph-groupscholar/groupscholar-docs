# Scholar Retention & Re-Engagement Playbook

## Summary
A practical playbook for keeping scholars engaged, reducing attrition risk, and re-engaging learners who go quiet. It defines early warning signals, tiered interventions, and operational rhythms across the scholar lifecycle.

## Objectives
- Maintain steady program engagement and completion rates.
- Identify and resolve barriers before they become attrition.
- Provide consistent re-entry pathways for paused scholars.
- Capture learnings to improve program design and support services.

## Retention stages
- Onboarding stabilization: weeks 0-4.
- Momentum building: weeks 5-12.
- Sustained engagement: mid-program.
- Transition readiness: final phase and alumni bridge.

## Risk signals
- Attendance drops (sessions, office hours, cohort events).
- Missed milestones or repeated late submissions.
- Reduced platform activity or unresponsive outreach.
- Financial stress signals (payment delays, emergency requests).
- Well-being flags (burnout, family obligations, health concerns).

## Intervention tiers
- Tier 1: gentle nudges and resource reminders within 3 business days.
- Tier 2: structured check-in with a success lead within 7 business days.
- Tier 3: escalation to safeguarding or program leadership within 10 business days.

## Re-engagement paths
- Re-entry sprint: 2-week plan to catch up on missed content.
- Accountability pairing: buddy or mentor pairing for 4 weeks.

- Alumni bridge if the scholar is transitioning out.

## Support plays
