# Alumni & Lifelong Engagement

## Summary
Group Scholar alumni are lifelong partners in our mission. This guide defines how we keep alumni connected, supported, and meaningfully engaged through clear lifecycle stages, consistent communications, and measurable outcomes.

## Outcomes we care about
- Alumni feel valued, connected, and informed.
- Alumni contribute back through mentorship, hiring, referrals, and giving.
- Alumni stories and data strengthen program credibility.
- Alumni have a reliable path for support after program completion.

## Alumni lifecycle stages
- **Pre-completion**: introduce alumni programming 90 days before program end.
- **Launch window (0-90 days)**: welcome series, alumni portal access, first alumni event invite.
- **Year 1**: mentorship matching, career support, quarterly check-in.
- **Years 2-5**: leadership roles, advisory panels, employer partner introductions.
- **Legacy (5+ years)**: alumni champions, donor circle, cohort storytellers.

## Engagement tiers
- **Observe**: receives newsletters and event invites.
- **Participate**: attends events or serves as a mentor.
- **Lead**: hosts sessions, mentors cohorts, or runs alumni chapters.
- **Champion**: serves on advisory boards, donor circle, or program ambassadors.
