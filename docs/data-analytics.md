# Data & Analytics Guide

## Summary
This guide defines how Group Scholar collects, governs, and uses data to make decisions and report outcomes.

## Data principles
- Collect only what we need to improve scholar outcomes.
- Treat data as a product with clear owners and users.
- Use consistent definitions across cohorts and partners.
- Bake privacy and consent into every workflow.

## Core data domains
- Scholar profile and eligibility data.
- Program delivery data (attendance, session notes, mentor feedback).
- Assessment and growth data.
- Partner engagement data (SLAs, requests, renewals).
- Finance and procurement data tied to programs.

## Ownership model
- Data steward: owns definitions and quality checks for a domain.
- Data custodian: ensures secure storage and access controls.
- Data consumer: uses data for reporting and decisions.

## Access and permissions
- Default to least-privilege access with quarterly reviews.
- Access requests are documented with purpose and duration.
- Sensitive datasets require explicit approval and audit logs.

## Analytics cadence
- Weekly: cohort health dashboard for program leads.
- Monthly: partner reporting pack with narrative insights.
- Quarterly: organization-wide review of outcomes and risks.
- Annual: impact report with longitudinal analysis.

## Data quality checks
- Validate completeness and accuracy within five business days.
- Track missing values, outliers, and inconsistent definitions.
- Maintain a data issue log with owners and resolution dates.

## Dashboards and artifacts
- Primary dashboard per cohort with standardized metrics.
- Metrics glossary maintained in the docs repository.
- Reporting packs stored by year, cohort, and partner.

## Data requests
- Submit requests with a clear question, deadline, and use case.
- Data steward confirms definitions and delivery timeline.
- Share final outputs with the requesting team and ops lead.

## Experimentation and learning
- Pre-register hypotheses and success metrics for tests.
- Use consistent comparison windows for cohorts.
- Document learnings in the program design archive.

## Escalation
- Quality issues that impact reporting trigger a review within one week.
- The data steward leads remediation with ops support.
- Notify partners if reporting timelines change.
