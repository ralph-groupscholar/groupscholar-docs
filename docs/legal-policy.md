# Legal & Policy

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar manages legal obligations, policy governance,
contracting, and records retention. It aligns internal teams on decision rights,
approval flow, and risk posture while keeping scholars and partners protected.

## Scope

- Policies owned by Group Scholar (internal, external-facing, and partner policies)
- Contracting workflows (vendors, partners, funders, and program participants)
- Regulatory compliance obligations and audit readiness
- Records retention and legal hold procedures

## Policy governance

- Policy owner: COO (operational policy) with counsel review where required.
- Policy cadence: annual refresh or upon material regulatory change.
- Review checklist: scope, affected teams, control updates, and training updates.
