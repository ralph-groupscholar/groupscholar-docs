# Community Engagement Guide

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar builds and sustains scholar, alumni, and partner communities. Use it to plan touchpoints, programs, and feedback loops that keep our community connected while honoring privacy and capacity.

## Goals

- Create a supportive network for scholars and alumni.
- Generate trusted feedback loops for program improvement.
- Turn community insights into product and program decisions.
- Protect participant time, data, and well-being.

## Audience segments

- Scholars: current program participants.
- Alumni: past recipients and program graduates.
- Partners: donors, sponsors, and institutional allies.
- Internal teams: program, partnerships, and success.

## Engagement tiers

- Core: high-touch cohort programs and advisory circles.
- Network: regular updates, peer connections, and office hours.
- Broad: newsletters, public events, and stories.

## Community lifecycle

1. Invite: clarify value, expectations, and privacy boundaries.
2. Onboard: provide welcome kit, code of conduct, and channels.
3. Engage: deliver scheduled touchpoints and peer matching.
4. Support: surface resources, troubleshooting, and escalation.
5. Celebrate: highlight wins, publish stories, and grant recognition.
6. Alumni: transition to mentorship and advisory roles.
