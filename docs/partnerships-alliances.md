# Partnerships & Alliances Guide

## Summary

This guide defines how Group Scholar identifies, evaluates, launches, and sustains partnerships that expand scholarship access and program outcomes.

## Scope

- Covers external partners: schools, community organizations, nonprofits, employers, foundations, and platform vendors.
- Excludes standard vendor procurement (see `finance-procurement.md`).
- Applies to new partnerships, renewals, and multi-party initiatives.

## Partnership goals

- Expand student reach and eligibility.
- Improve program quality, outcomes, and equity.
- Reduce delivery friction through shared infrastructure.
- Strengthen funding resilience through diversified support.

## Partnership types

- **Program partners**: co-deliver scholarship programming and services.
- **Referral partners**: connect eligible learners to programs.
- **Data partners**: share outcomes or eligibility data under strict privacy terms.
- **Funding partners**: provide grants, sponsorships, or matching funds.
- **Distribution partners**: help promote or embed Group Scholar programs.

## Intake checklist

- Mission alignment and equity commitment.
- Target population, geography, and scale.
- Required data sharing and privacy constraints.
- Resource requirements (staff time, funding, tooling).
- Risk profile (brand, legal, operational).

## Evaluation rubric

- **Strategic fit**: does this expand reach or depth meaningfully?
- **Operational readiness**: can both sides deliver on time?
- **Data integrity**: can we confirm outcomes and quality?
- **Sustainability**: is there a path to multi-year impact?
- **Equity impact**: does this reduce barriers or widen gaps?

## Partnership lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: intake, initial conversations, and alignment check.
2. **Assessment**: scope, resource model, timeline, and risks.
3. **Agreement**: roles, responsibilities, and metrics captured.
4. **Launch**: onboarding, shared calendar, and comms plan.
5. **Delivery**: weekly coordination, issues log, and KPI tracking.
6. **Review**: outcomes analysis, renewal decision, and improvements.

## Required artifacts

- Partnership brief (scope, goals, KPIs, timeline).
- Roles and responsibilities matrix.
- Data-sharing agreement or addendum (if applicable).
- Launch plan with milestones and owners.
- Quarterly impact review deck.

## Governance and cadence

- Assign a single partnership owner at Group Scholar.
- Weekly or biweekly syncs during launch.
- Monthly KPI review once stable.
- Quarterly executive check-in with renewal decision points.

## KPI examples

- Learners reached, eligible, and awarded.
- Application completion rates.
- Time-to-award cycle time.

## Risk management

- Create a shared risk log and mitigation owners.
- Document brand and messaging approvals upfront.
- Confirm data transfer methods meet security standards.
- Define exit conditions and wind-down plan.

## Escalation paths

- Operational blockers: partnership owner to ops lead.
- Data/privacy issues: security and legal review.
- Brand concerns: marketing approval required.

## First 30 days launch plan
