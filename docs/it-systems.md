# IT & Systems

## Summary
Group Scholar keeps a reliable, secure tool stack through clear access provisioning, device standards, and shared ownership of system health.

## Core tooling stack
- Identity: SSO + MFA for all business-critical tools.
- Collaboration: email, calendar, chat, docs, and meeting notes.
- Delivery: project tracker, support desk, and incident channel.
- Data: analytics warehouse, dashboards, and experiment logs.
- Finance: expenses, invoicing, vendor contracts, and approvals.

## Access provisioning
- New hire requests are submitted with role, team, and manager approval.
- Default access is least privilege; add elevated access only when needed.
- Provisioning SLA is 1 business day for standard tools.
- Document every access change in the onboarding checklist.

## Device and endpoint standards
- Company devices are required for data handling roles.
- Enable disk encryption, automatic updates, and screen lock.
- Use password managers for all credentials.
- Lost or stolen devices must be reported within 1 hour.

## Account lifecycle
- Onboarding includes tool setup, SSO enrollment, and security training.
- Role changes trigger an access review within 5 business days.
- Departures are deprovisioned same-day and audited the following week.
- Disable accounts for inactive contractors after 30 days.

## System ownership
- Each system has an owner, backup owner, and support channel.
- Owners maintain an up-to-date runbook and access list.
- Major tool changes require a brief migration plan and comms draft.

## Backup and continuity
- Critical data is backed up daily with weekly restore checks.
- Keep a minimal offline export for program-critical datasets.
- Incident response is coordinated with Security & Privacy guidance.

## Support and escalation
- Report tool outages in the #ops channel with impact summary.
- Escalate security issues via the #security channel immediately.
- Track incidents in the operations playbook with resolution notes.

## Audit checklist
- Quarterly review of SSO, MFA, and admin access.
- Verify licensing, usage, and redundant tools.
