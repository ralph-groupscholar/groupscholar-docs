# Grant Compliance & Reporting

## Summary
A shared playbook for meeting grant obligations, maintaining evidence trails, and keeping funders confident in Group Scholar delivery.

## Purpose
- Ensure every grant has clear reporting requirements, owners, and deadlines.
- Maintain audit-ready documentation across program, finance, and impact.
- Protect funder trust through consistent, on-time, and accurate reporting.

## Core obligations

- Required data points (participant counts, outcomes, demographics, spend).
- Narrative updates (program progress, challenges, adaptations).
- Financial documentation (budget vs actuals, allowable costs, match).
- Branding and acknowledgement requirements.

## Compliance calendar
- Build a grant-level calendar at award kickoff.
- Track due dates, internal review windows, and submission owners.
- Review cadence monthly in Ops and before board updates.
