# Equity & Inclusion Guide

## Summary
Group Scholar designs programs so every scholar and partner feels respected, represented, and supported. This guide outlines the commitments, workflows, and checks that keep equity and inclusion embedded in how we operate.

## Core commitments
- Center scholars with lived experience in program design and evaluation.
- Build accessibility in from the start, not as a retrofit.
- Reduce bias in selection and review decisions through consistent rubrics.
- Use language that is affirming, precise, and culturally aware.
- Measure disparities and act quickly when gaps appear.

## Inclusive program design
- Require a stakeholder map for every new program (scholars, families, schools, community partners).
- Run a pre-launch inclusion review for eligibility, outreach, and timeline barriers.
- Offer multiple submission pathways (online, offline, mobile-friendly).
- Provide flexible deadlines or extension paths for documented hardships.

## Communication standards
- Use plain-language summaries for all critical updates.
- Provide translations for top languages in active regions.
- Avoid deficit framing; emphasize strengths and growth.
- Maintain a respectful tone in all automated reminders.

## Accessibility checklist
- Ensure all PDFs are screen-reader friendly.
- Add captions to video content and transcripts for audio.
- Test key flows on low-bandwidth connections and mobile devices.
- Include alt text on all images and graphics.

## Review fairness and bias mitigation
- Use structured rubrics with clear scoring anchors.
- Include calibration sessions before each review cycle.
- Run anonymization steps for essays where possible.
- Monitor reviewer variance and retrain when drift appears.

## Data practices
- Tag demographic data as sensitive and restrict access by default.
- Report outcomes by subgroup to identify gaps.
- Use minimum cell sizes for any published reporting.

## Training and accountability
- Provide annual equity and inclusion training for staff and reviewers.
- Require new hires to complete a bias-mitigation onboarding module.
- Track corrective actions when inequities are identified.

## Metrics to monitor
- Application-to-award conversion by subgroup.
- Scholar satisfaction and belonging indicators.
- Response time disparities by region or segment.
- Accessibility incident count and resolution time.

## Escalation and remediation
- Create an inclusion incident intake form and response SLA.
- Assign an owner for each remediation plan.
- Publish quarterly updates on progress and improvements.
