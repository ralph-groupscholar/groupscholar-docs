# Support Case Management Guide

## Summary

This guide outlines how Group Scholar manages scholar, partner, and internal support requests as structured cases. Use it to keep triage, documentation, and resolution consistent across teams while protecting privacy and ensuring timely follow-through.

## Goals

- Provide a single, reliable workflow for every support request.
- Capture complete context so cases can be handed off without gaps.
- Resolve issues quickly while documenting decisions and outcomes.
- Surface trends that inform program and product improvements.

## Case intake standards

- Use the shared support inbox or form as the single intake channel.
- Create a case for every request, even if it is resolved quickly.
- Require a structured summary before assigning an owner.
- Link related cases to prevent duplicate work.

## Required case fields

- Requestor name, cohort, and preferred contact channel.
- Category (payments, access, scheduling, program, safeguarding, other).
- Urgency level (routine, time-sensitive, critical).
- Summary of the issue in one sentence.
- Detailed notes with timeline and any attachments.
- Owner, backup owner, and target resolution date.

## Case lifecycle

1. Intake: capture the request, confirm details, and set expectations.
2. Triage: categorize, assign owner, and set urgency level.
3. Investigate: gather context, confirm dependencies, and check policy.
4. Resolve: complete actions, share outcomes, and document evidence.
5. Close: confirm with requestor, capture feedback, and tag root cause.
6. Review: add learning notes for process or policy updates.

## Service-level expectations

- Routine: acknowledge within 1 business day, resolve within 5 days.
- Time-sensitive: acknowledge within 4 hours, resolve within 2 days.
- Critical: acknowledge immediately, engage escalation owner within 1 hour.

## Escalation triggers

- Safety or well-being concerns.
- Financial disbursement errors or fraud risk.
- Legal, compliance, or reputational risk.
- Repeated issues affecting multiple scholars.

## Documentation hygiene

- Capture decisions, owners, and timestamps for every change.
- Use clear, neutral language and avoid speculation.
- Separate facts from assumptions or pending verification.
- Store sensitive data only in approved systems.

## Coordination and handoffs

- Add a handoff note when ownership changes.
- Confirm the next action, owner, and deadline in the case log.
- Use a standardized handoff template for complex cases.

## Quality checks

- Verify the root cause tag before closing.
- Confirm the requestor received a resolution summary.
- Add a process improvement note for repeat issues.

## Reporting cadence

- Weekly: case volume, top categories, and open aging.
- Monthly: SLA compliance, escalations, and recurring issues.
- Quarterly: policy updates and tooling improvements.

## Roles and ownership

- Support lead: owns workflow standards and reporting.
- Program managers: resolve cohort-specific cases.
- Finance operations: handle disbursement and payment cases.
- Safeguarding lead: owns critical safety escalations.

## Templates to reuse

- Intake form with required fields and consent language.
- Resolution summary note.
- Escalation brief with context and actions taken.
- Case closure checklist.
